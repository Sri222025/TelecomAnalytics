Not just dashboards - the AI proactively finds problems:

Spots issues you didn't know existed
Explains the impact of each issue
Provides specific recommendations
Prioritizes by severity
3. Telecom Domain Intelligence
Built specifically for telecom operations:

Recognizes telecom-specific columns
Calculates industry-standard KPIs
Understands POTS, JioJoin, STB, AirFiber
Regional/Circle analysis
4. Zero-Code Operation
Your team can use it immediately:

No Python knowledge required
No SQL needed
No configuration files to edit
Point-and-click interface
5. Cloud-Native & Free
Hosted on Streamlit Cloud (free tier)
No servers to manage
Accessible from any browser
Shareable URL
